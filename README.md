# GPClaimRollback

GPClaimRollback is a simple and lightweight add-on for the Minecraft Plugins GriefPrevention and CoreProtect. 

The add-on enables automatically resetting claimed territories to their original state once the claimed land is deleted. All player modifications within the territories are completely wiped. The purpose of the add-on is to enhance the longevity of a Minecraft world. The features allow popular territories to be made available again for new players or the restoration of the normal environment if the original plot owners are no longer actively playing on the server.

Tested Minecraft Versions: *1.20**
